	Instead of lines like: universe.art_temp.Add(art_resource.New());
	We should have universe.AddTempArt(art_resource.New());
	Ect. There are many cases of this.

	On a similar note: weapon = AssetWeaponTemplates.weapon_templates[template_name].New();
	is a bit nasty. AssetWeaponTemplates.Get(template_name).New(); is a bit nicer.



> Damage handling
	Not implemented:
		- Armor passing through em damage
		- Radius affecting multiple armor segments


> Line arc art is a bit speckly. Explore the extention of line segments to combat this
	LineArt.DrawArcU draws an ard by drawing multiple line segments
	Aliasing causes some pixels to get left out.
	Overdrawing the lines a little should fix the problem.


> Thrusters need sparkle ports.
> Particle system overhaul needed
	- fewer but more detailed particles
	- dump thruster particles completely
	- explosion particle methods
	- examine the particle inheritance model
