	Instead of lines like: universe.art_temp.Add(art_resource.New());
	We should have universe.AddTempArt(art_resource.New());
	Ect. There are many cases of this.

	On a similar note: weapon = AssetWeaponTemplates.weapon_templates[template_name].New();
	is a bit nasty. AssetWeaponTemplates.Get(template_name).New(); is a bit nicer.



> Damage handling
	Not implemented:
		- Armor passing through em damage
		- Radius affecting multiple armor segments


> Line arc art is a bit speckly. Explore the extention of line segments to combat this
	LineArt.DrawArcU draws an ard by drawing multiple line segments
	Aliasing causes some pixels to get left out.
	Overdrawing the lines a little should fix the problem.

		Currently the stat drawing is a huge mess.
		Its unclear whether stuff is drawn wrt to global coords or onscreen coords
		The code is split between StatusCamera and Camera
		> There is (was?) a kind of logic behind it:
			The Camera can draw status bars anywhere, but the StatusCamera will have the code
			for a full readout


> The creation of all Components through ComponentTemplate models:
	In most places, Components have public properties, and the ComponentTemplate spawns them
	through ComponentTemplate.New()

	Instead, the template should just be passed into the component, and the component
	does the initilisation.
	Then as many properties as we can become private var
	Or at least public var {get; private set;} if then need to be publically read
	
	The following have this problem and need to be signed off:
		- Components
			- ComponentArmor
			- ComponentShield
			- ComponentThrusters
			- ComponentWeapon
		- Art
			- ArtExplosion
			- ArtThruster
			- ArtSprite
			- ArtShield
			- ArtVent
		- And Ships
