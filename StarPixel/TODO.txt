> Line arc art is a bit speckly. Explore the extention of individual arc line segments to combat this
	LineArt.DrawArcU draws an ard by drawing multiple line segments
	Aliasing causes some pixels to get left out.
	Overdrawing the lines a little should fix the problem.

> Thrusters need sparkle ports.
> Dont handle thrusters as particles at all, except for sparkles
> Particle system overhaul needed
	- fewer but more detailed particles
	- dump thruster particles completely
	- explosion particle methods
	- examine the particle inheritance model

> Change ArtTempory handling somehow to allow multiple ArtTemporarys per payload

> New particles:
	- Shockware
	- Brilliance
	- Burst
	- Electricity

> More particle effects
	- Bright
	- Flickering
	- Rotating

> Extend thermocolor range further into the blue

//++++ REFACTORING ++++//

	- These will need to be saved

> Standardise up how things are handed to the universe... maybe... eh.
	Instead of lines like: universe.art_temp.Add(art_resource.New());
	We should have universe.AddTempArt(art_resource.New());
	Ect. There are many cases of this.

	On a similar note: weapon = AssetWeaponTemplates.weapon_templates[template_name].New();
	is a bit nasty. AssetWeaponTemplates.Get(template_name).New(); is a bit nicer.

	I am unsure how I feel about a lot of this atm. It really needs looking at with fresh eyes.

//---- REFACTORING ----//


//++++ FUTUREPROOFING ++++//

> Break down object update process
	- Needed for potential multithreading
	- AI updates cannot be done at the same time as physical updates

> Special collision detection cases for objects with a high relative speed.
	- Possibly only nessicary for projectile to physical hitchecks.

//---- FUTUREPROOFING ----//


//++++ SHIP MODELING ++++//

> Damage handling
	Not implemented:
		- Armor passing through em damage
		- Radius affecting multiple armor segments
	- Add in explosion knockback

> Implement sensor component and sensor model.
	- Sensability affected by heat, size, distance, possibly shield output
	- Small ships should be able to "go dark"

> Implement component power and reactor

> Implement component heat model
	- Will also lead to implementing thermal damage model
	- Hull heat sprite

> Rebalance the thruster mass balance.
	- Larger ships should not be orders of magnitude slower than smaller ships
	- Its just bad for balance. Small ships only need a moderate accelleration advantage to get a lot of leverage.
	- Large ships should turn a lot slower however
	- Large ship intertia is completely out of whack. Need to come up with a good mass - torque curve

//---- SHIP MODERLING ----//


//++++ USER INTERFACE ++++//

// #2 PRIORITY
> Build up the UI system, and start implementing some useful windows
	- Button widget elements
	- Display graphs for components of selected ships. Some kind of toggle for whether power/heat/health/em is displayed

> Simulation speed widget
